fixed potion identification
fixed missing attack for 'kicks you' (mystics)
resist fear instrinsic added
monster fear
added autoroller from PC code
CFT's new speed code
mana penalty for armour based on weight (doesn't seem to change much), and
       gloves of free action/dexterity don't cause the additional mana penalty
print amount of gold stolen
print object stolen
artifacts likely to resist enchantment/disenchantment & other attacks
monsters can pick up things (but not 'X' getting Slay 'X' weapons, etc)
if blind then messages change - serious updating
   -- also redo 2ndary effects, this was a pain in the butt
fix up earthquake effects to not destroy artifacts & some other things
the names of the Phial, Star, & Arkenstone change if not identified
fixed up naming code a little, also renamed monster descriptions & fixed
   miscellaneous spelling errors whenever I ran across them
can check what artifacts have been generated while not wizard
   -- for convenience only, if you don't like, don't use....
add y/n to word of recall spells...
fireball effects now have differing radii
giant pits added
vastly more sanity checking in level generation
more sanity checking in compact_monsters & create/summon monsters...
more uniques have appropriate escorts
destroyed levels added
player ghost/save bug fixed
be a little nicer about out-of-depth monsters on the early levels....
...and added moria 5.5 'sleeping dragon' code
fixed up the artifacts a little (like being frost brand and not RC, etc)
   added TR_BLESS_BLADE & TR_ATTACK_SPEED)  Ringil is still +1 speed, though.
   added another resistance to one or two items ala Fangband
Holy Avengers & Slay Evil weapons are BLESS_BLADE, Slay Undead are HOLD_LIFE.
prayer penalty for priests not using blessed edged weapons
cleaned up the display a little
hopefully reset stats correctly when gaining or losing....
better messages when an item gets destroyed
minimum weight for multiple attack calc reduced from 5 to 3
prevented free bashing from detecting an invisible monster

tweaked self knowledge messages for clarity


Angband 2.5.1 (12/15/93)

fixed inventory bug w/ taking off equipped items
fixed delay causing divide-by-zero crashes
made word of recall a toggle, not yes/no, as that seems to be less aggravating
maybe fixed redisplay on edge of maps
fixed open/topen/fopen/tfopen which already exists on some systems
fixed a possible problem with displaying monster injury status
fixed a problem displaying the level feelings
fixed dropping worthless items in your home (they silently disappeared)
silently reconnect invisible monsters (*why* does this happen?)
fixed light redisplay while in stores (thanks to DGK)
adjusted code to stop allocating too high plusses on magical items and
   too many bows of might/accuracy.
fixed desc_monsters.c overrun causing crash when looking at ghosts
added some bounds checking on reading options st 2.4 savefiles don't mess up
readjusted magical plusses some more, made more things variable (such as AC + 
   for Amulet of Magi, etc ad nauseaum), also caused prices to be more
   responsive to the pluses on the items
redid monster fear code so that some monsters are 'fearless': E's, g's, most
   undead and demons except intelligent ones, and all immobile monsters
added global variable monster_is_afraid so that fear messages only occur after
   the player has gotten all of his swings; much nicer to look at
monsters that heal themselves may 'regain their courage' when they cast heal
PDSM no longer resists disenchantment or shards -- so watch out!  Note that
   Bladeturner still resists everything, so it becomes a better choice.


Angband 2.5.2 (12/20/93)
CFT's revamped inven_carry, fixes book ordering for magic users
included code for BSD's random() function, which offers a much better RNG;
   please consult the file src/random.c for copyright and acknowledgements...
fixed "killed by an arrow trap.." (doubled period) and "up staircase ." msgs
went back and redid objdes() code to fix a whole bunch of punctuation errors,
   including inscriptions, monster/item <--> spell interactions, etc; the
   results should look better and probably work faster, too
genderized the whole game, including massive changes to recall.c.  It makes the
   program a little larger, but the descriptions are incredibly more cool
resyncronized monsters.c with describe_mon.c, fixed some minor incongruities
  as I came across them (such as immobile monsters 'being able to open doors')


Angband 2.5.3 (1/10/94)
fixed a typo giveing Bladeturner +305 to AC (thanks DGK)
fixed misspelling David G. Kahane's initials in a few places (sorry DGK :)
added support for HPUX thanks to Chris Ang@amd.com [cba]

tweaked the recall monster code some
fixed 'screen too small for moria --> angband' message

turned down the delays a little...
worked around the 'infamous monster heal bug', when restoring savefiles
fixed a few more monster descriptions (made worm mass descriptions consistant)
fixed 'Set of Cestus' to 'Set of Cesti'
reindented the whole set of source code; use 4-2 indenting & a 90 col editor
reindentation has revealed some questionable syntax RE: '=&' vs '= &' which
  may have caused some subtle bugs

Angband 2.5.3 (1/12/94?) - beta testing begins
added support for ultrix thanks to Eugene Hung@garnet.berkeley.edu
fixed monsters running away due to '= -' versus '-='
moved the gender code into the creature_list array and reordered the
  descriptions so that desc_list[i] = c_list[i], this was a pain, but I caught
  a few more inconsistancies doing so
fixed up some of the library files
Anduril is now "The Longsword 'Anduril'", thanks J.Kewley@fiveg.icl.co.uk
added an option "plain_descriptions" so that items will be displayed without
  their 'flavor' if that's what the user prefers
fixed some bugs in the util.c for supporting microsleep on those machines that
  need it
modified object creation so that it makes objects at the average of the
  dun_level and the creature's level....
fixed possibly letting character go up and down stairs first 100 turns and get
  feelings each time.....
made see invisible never auto-detect, as this is not worth fixing right
fixed keypad wizard commands (made 'em the save as the rogue wizard commands)
added flag for haggling rather than a compile-time define....
fixed a few more '= -' expressions
fixed a bug in the wizard level identify code
fixed Makefile bug ".o.c" versus ".c.o".... [eh]
touched up a few artifacts (Beleg C. -> Belthronding), Sting vs. Weap of
   Westernesse, made artifacts display a little more info (searching, infra)
fixed a problem in the microsleep code with times of 0
moved Master Mystics to dun_level 50...
fixed unique deaths not being recalled if you can't see them when they die
patched a few more non-ANSI-compiler problems, & min/max [cba]
fixed teleporting leaving lighted area with wide-area light
redid some of the object description code to give more informative messages
  and to avoid some braindamage
added option to display weight for equipment list (seperate from inven list)
  because new descriptions can be longer and will overrun the available space
fixed a possible lighting bug (casting light spell with light item), and made
  unlighting a little more impressive...
fixed overlong inscriptions (thanks grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu)
made monsters resist damage from weapons a little better
added compile define to let players see their score, fixed scorefile bug;
  (thanks to Torbj|rn Lindgren <tl@cd.chalmers.se>)
fixed minor misspellings
tried to fix up some minor lighting errors; also touched up a monster or two
fixed object descriptions displaying the p1 value inappropriately (+x)
removed LINT_ARG define so that we always get function prototypes...
Large kobolds resist poison too
tweaked the Makefile some more (make clean does better now)

   the player ghost violate the const char * of the monster list -- oh well

made wide-area light light up "knight-move" (L's) squares
made pits not activate the "special" message but vaults will....
error in "if (t_ptr->name2 = SN_ATTACKS)" fixed (BIG thanks to jk@cs.man.ac.uk)
