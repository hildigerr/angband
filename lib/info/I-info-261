Angband 2.6.1 version 2 for the Macintosh.

This is version 2 of Angband 2.6.1 for the Macintosh.  It should run on
any 68000 with System 6.0.1? or higher OS.

It *SHOULD* be savefile-compatible with all other 2.6.1's on other platforms.
Remember to use BINARY when ftping!  This will also work with savefiles from
MacAngband 2.5.8.  (But 2.5.8 won't work with savefiles from 2.6.1!)

You can add fonts and sizes to the font and size menu using ResEdit.  Be sure the
fonts you add are fixed width fonts.  A list of fonts available on your system
can be obtained by looking at the Key Caps menu.

Please let me know if you encounter a bug, and try to describe it so that I can
reproduce it (mail me a binhex'd copy of your savefile if that will help).  Also,
any comments or suggestions you have will be greatly appreciated.

Send any comments, suggestions, and bugs to:

Known Bugs:

- Sometimes MacAngband can't find the lib directory- this is caused by an
   incompatibility with some INITs.  MacAngband will ask you to locate the
   lib directory manually if this occurs.  If this doesn't work, try putting
   the lib directory in your root directory.

Fixes to 2.5.8:
- the "never generates a magic cloak" bug has been fixed.

beta version B1 uploaded on 8/28/94

Fixes in version 1:
- goes to the background gracefully when autorolling & running down corridors.
- enter key works like return key, arrow keys work as direction keys.
- Save (command-S) saves but doesn't quit.  Save and Quit (comand-Q) saves & quits.
  Quit (command-.) quits without saving (warning is given).
- Q to exit option after generating character quits correctly (no savefile is created).
- blindness bug is fixed (this was a bug in 2.5.8).
- removed cursor from around @ by popular demand (I kind of liked it... :( ).
- lowered memory requirements to a reasonable limit.
- added Courier as a font and made it so you can add your own fonts/sizes using ResEdit.
  Added checkmarks to mark current font/size selection.
- new icons courtesy of Sheldon Dyck (thanks!).
- fixed Olog-Hai and Uruk-Hai not appearing in vaults.
- a few monster color changes.
- some color enhancements for items.
- made some alerts and dialogs self-centering.
- made system 6 compatible (color, standard file the main issues).
- made font size selection work correctly under sys6.
- increased memory limit some because the high-score list is a memory hog.
- fixed saving sometimes giving you an extra turn.
- fixed ^P giving bad +tohit,+todam in autoroller.  Added "hit any key to stop"
  message also.
- more graceful size adjustment when changing fonts in sys6.
- added hide/show command for recall window.

version 1 uploaded on 9/17/94

Changes in version 2:
- changed angband.man.txt to Angband Manual and made it a Word document.
- double-clicking on Angband text files opens Angband but doesn't give the
  cryptic "could not open save file" message.
- Fixed up some sys6 incompatibilities in the <f>ile character description option.
  Made descriptions a TeachText document.
- Colored change name screen.
- Added dialogs/alerts/etc... to get the user to locate the lib directory if
  MacAngband can't find it itself.
- *** updated to 2.6.1 ***
- put in some print queueing to try to speed up things (wide-area light, in particular)
- cleaned up character generation colors and speed.
- made saving a little more safe: .old and .new files are created if something
  goes terribly wrong (like crashing during a save)
- made high score list much less of a memory hog.
- fixed bug of recall window not appearing on small screens.
- fixed "staisfy hunger" spelling in spellbook.
- added bold font option.
- added yellow floor as an option for all those pansies out there who can't take it.
- fixed long line wrapping bug.
