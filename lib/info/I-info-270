=== Basic "changes" from Angband 2.6.1 to Angband 2.7.0 ===

Parsing of Item kinds from text files
Properly handled "identify" inducing object "awareness" and "combining".
Functions combine() and combine_pack() to maintain inventory.
Made "store cost" a property of objects

Parsing of monster race info from a text file.
Functions floor_grid(), clean_grid(), and valid_grid().
Rewrote store "maintainance" code.
Major rewrite of the "savefile" code, plus "parser" for old files.
Addition of a generic method for "machine dependant savefile info".
Rewrite of the "pathname constructor" code.
Added floating point (yuck!) to "standard deviation" code.
Redid the targetting code, and the direction code.
Cleaned up the header files (a lot).
Separated out some generic "non-angband" files (like random.c).
Added files to do "memory management" and "string formatting".
Renamed a LOT of variables/fields to more "consistent" forms.
Forced "flag constants" to refer to theie "flag set" explicitly.
Fixed a few old bugs based in misplacement of certain flags.
Reorganized the source to make the files more "self-contained".

Threw out the "Bill Cosby" message.  "Cute" is not "good".
Added monster race fields for "current/max" population per level.
Considered using this instead of the old "reproduction limits".
Cleaned up the use of "hack_monptr" in a BIG way.
Separated "update_monsters()" from "process_monsters()".
Put "XXX" and "Hack" in the code to label areas of future work.
