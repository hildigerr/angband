Rewrite of the "pathname constructor" code.
Added floating point (yuck!) to "standard deviation" code.
Redid the targetting code, and the direction code.
Cleaned up the header files (a lot).
Separated out some generic "non-angband" files (like random.c).
Added files to do "memory management" and "string formatting".
