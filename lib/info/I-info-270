=== Basic "changes" from Angband 2.6.1 to Angband 2.7.0 ===

Functions floor_grid(), clean_grid(), and valid_grid().
Rewrite of the "pathname constructor" code.
Added floating point (yuck!) to "standard deviation" code.
Redid the targetting code, and the direction code.
Cleaned up the header files (a lot).
Separated out some generic "non-angband" files (like random.c).
Added files to do "memory management" and "string formatting".
Renamed a LOT of variables/fields to more "consistent" forms.
Forced "flag constants" to refer to theie "flag set" explicitly.
Reorganized the source to make the files more "self-contained".

Put "XXX" and "Hack" in the code to label areas of future work.
