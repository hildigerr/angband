   Most bugs in Angband have been fixed now, these are the ones that may turn
up, but have a habit of not doing so when you're trying to test them in wiz
mode!

	Angband is based on Umoria 5.2.1 so any changes made in the conversion
to Umoria 5.5 may still be in Angband... this includes the invisible
indestructible monster bug, which definitely used to occur but I haven't seen
for a while now. David Grabiner sent me the changes file from 5.2.1 to 5.5 and
I couldn't see the difference so I figure it may have been fixed.
	When creatures have the drop flag SPECIAL, which should only create
artifacts and excellent items (Animal Slaying, Holy Avenger etc.), often
normal bows are created... I think bows and/or slings may be being given an
excellent flag, but not sure.
	Shadow Cloaks always seem to have a +4 enchantment for some reason.
	Paladins have been known to lose all their spells around about 29-31
and the only way to get them back is to go up another level. This may have
been fixed now.
	Max HPs for some monsters seems to get set to 0.  This used to
cause the "monster heal bug", but we've kludged around it by forcing it
to recalculate max HPs if it finds this when healing.  But we still haven't
found the underlying problem.
	Sometimes, Probing (staff/rod/spell) just ignores some monsters,
as if they didn't exist.
	Sometimes when an object is to clear in the shops, the shopkeeper
still asks for the full price, not 10% of it like he should do. This may only
occur for stackable objects.

	Please mail any other bugs/fixes to smarsh@dcs.warwick.ac.uk.
