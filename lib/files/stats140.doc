  As part of the changes to PC Angband 1.40, I maximum stat. values are
adjusted from 18/100 by your race and class adjustments.  To insure
balance and playability, I had to alter some racial and profession
adjustments.  Below are the new tables.


Racial Stat. Adjustments

  Race		STR	INT	WIS	DEX	CON	CHR
Human		 +1	---	---	 +1	---	 +1
Dunadan		 +1	 +1	 +1	 +1	 +1	 +2
Half Elf	---	 +1	 +1	 +2	---	 +2
Elf		---	 +1	---	 +2	 -1	 +2
High Elf	---	 +2	 +1	 +2	 -1	 +4
Dwarf		 +2	 -1	 +2	---	 +2	 -1
Hobbit		 -1	 +2	 +1	 +3	 +1	 +1
Gnome		 -1	 +2	---	 +2	 -1	 -1
Half Orc	 +2	 -1	 -1	---	 +2	 -4
Half Troll	 +4	 -3	 -3	 -1	 +3	 -6

======================================================================


Professional Stat. Adjustments:

  Class		STR	INT	WIS	DEX	CON	CHR
Warrior		 +5	 -2	 -2	 +2	 +3	---
Rogue		 +2	 +1	 -1	 +4	 +1	 -2
Ranger		 +1	 +2	 -1	 +2	 +1	 +1
Paladin		 +3	 -1	 +2	 +1	 +2	 +2
Mage		 -4	 +4	---	---	 -2	 +1
Priest		 -1	---	 +4	---	---	 +2

======================================================================

  As you can see, the biggest racial changes were to High Elves,
Half Elves, and Dunadan.  I reduced the High Elven and Dunadan bonuses,
because they were simply too high now that they affect maximum stats.
And the Half Elven bonuses were improved, on the basis that Half Elves
are descended from Beren & Luthien (daughter of Thingol & Melian the
Maia).  With this heritage, they deserve to be on par with Elves and
High Elves, not as second-rate elves.

  For the Professional adjustments, the changes were basically that each
Warriors, Rogues, Mages, and Priests got bigger bonuses to STR, DEX,
INT, and WIS -- big enough to differentiate them from Rangers and
Paladins, I believe.
