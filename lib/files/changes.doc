  The changes.tc file records (in prose. It's NOT a diff) the changes
I've made to the Angband source since I received an alpha version of
the Unix Angband source in February.  Often, it tells WHY the change
was made, as well as what was done.

  Be careful (and forgiving) of my changes.tc file...  I wrote it as I
was trying to get Angband to compile, and then as I fixed things, so it
occasionally says "I did X", and then later says "I un-did X".  I have
cleaned it up a little, but I figured it would be safer to delete too
little than to erase too much (esp since it my ONLY record of my changes).
Since I typed it as I made changes, often late at night, the quality of
my spelling, punctuation, and typing is fairly low.  If you have any
important questions about something I've written, feel free to ask...
