  Targetting code allows you to "lock phasers" onto a monster or a location.
It allows you to fire spells/aim wands/shoot arrows/etc at something without
being "lined up" with it.  It also is convenient if you are going to fire
many arrows/magic missiles/etc at one target.  I added in Chris Wilde's
targetting code from Morgul for convenience, and to make the code slightly
more fair to players -- monsters can cast spells when not "in line"
with you, now the player can cast them back.

  To use it, start by using the '*' command.  This is a "free turn" command,
and so you don't have to worry about making a mistake, and costing your
character an important round.  If there are any monsters visible, and in
range, then the targetting code will start by going through them.  At
this point, you can hit 'r' to see more info about the monster, or
either 't' or '.' to select that monster as the target.  Or you can
type 'l' to tell the targetting code that you wish to aim at a location,
rather than at a monster.  Hitting ESC will abort targetting, turning
off any pre-existing target.  Any other key will move through the monsters
available.

  If there are no monsters in sight, or you've cycled through them all,
it will then move the cursor to your character, from where you can use the
cursor keys to move it to the desired location, and then hit 't' or '.'
to select the current cursor location as the target.  Hitting ESC will
abort targetting and turn off any pre-existing target.

  Once you have selected a target, you can cast spells, throw things,
shoot arrows, zap wands, etc.  All of these will automatically be fired
at the current target, without bothering you to ask what direction.  This
is why I say that targetting can be convenient if you are going to fire
a lot of arrows/magic missiles/etc at something.

  Another benefit of targetting is that "ball spells" will now bypass
intervening monsters to reach the target, like monster's breath weapons
and ball spells do to reach you.  This is another way in which targetting
makes Angband fairer to the player.

  If you target on a monster, then the target will move with that monster.
If you've targetted a location, even if there was a monster at that
location, the target stays at that location.

  If you were targetting a monster, and the monster dies, then targetting is
automatically turned-off.  If you were targetting a location, and no longer
wish to target there anymore, you must turn off targetting manually, by
using the '*' command and hitting ESC.

  One further point:  If you are targetting, and cannot see your target,
then you will have to aim manually, in one of the 8 directions.  This
could happen if the target is out of range, or if you've phase door-ed
away, and there is now a wall between you and your target, or, if you
were targetting a monster, if you cannot see that monster at the moment.
This does not turn off targetting, merely suspends it.  So, when you
can see your target again, targetting will work as before.

  A final note:  I have still been unable to reach Chris Wilde to formally
ask his permission to use his targetting code.  (All of the email addresses
that I've tried seem to be outdated).  So I am technically violating his
copyright to use his code.  I have tried to give him full credit for the
targetting code, and I do not think he will refuse permission to use the
code once I do ask him, but it _IS_ within his rights.  If that happens,
I will have to remove the targetting code altogether from Angband, since
the code is all based directly on his code.
