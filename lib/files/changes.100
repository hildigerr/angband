constant.h:	  MAX_TALLOC changed from 2000 to 500 to better fit msdos mem limits -CFT
	MAX_MALLOC changed from 1500 to 400 ditto -CFT
	MAX_SAVE_HISCORES from 500 to 50 ditto -CFT
	MAX_QUESTS from 255 to 4 (only 1 defined anyway...) -CFT
main.c:	  struct rlimit rlp + references ifndef-ed;  Seems like Unix code to
		limit the size of core dumps; uneeded + undefined on PCs -CFT
config.h:	  File pathnames changed to direct code.  TC isn't expanding LIBDIR
		and concatenating the rest properly... CFT
	Also / to \ conversion in paths... (both these changes inside #ifdefs)
misc1.c:	  statstime struct ifndef-ed.  It seemed to keep tabs on CPU use/mem use/
		page faults/etc.  Not Applic for PCs -CFT
	check_time() fn which used statstime ifndef-ed to not use it.  -CFT
files.c:	  include of <sys/param.h> now #ifndef-ed so that TC will not try. -CFT
death.c:	  cast to off_t inside call to lseek() changed to #ifndef BSD4_3, copied
		 from above in the file.  Looks like a minor change that got
		only 1/2 done...	-CFT
	signal(SIGTSTP, SIG_IGN) ifndef-ed out at line 165  -CFT
	calls to flock() during hi-score saving ifndef-ed out; no flock()
		(and no reason for it) on msdos... -CFT
save.c:	  Added conditional definition of t_ptr back into sv_write().  It's
		used in the PC code.  You folks probably took it out, and
		never noticed; only needed for PC or atari ST... -CFT
	Also in get_char, ditto -CFT
types.h:	  #ifdef MSDOSed types of exist + dead inside of unique_mon struct from
		int to int8u.  They're just booleans...  No need to
		use an int.  I only noticed because variable.c gave me
		"Too much global data" error message...  *sigh*  64k
		segment sizes are annoying...  -CFT
save.c:	  #ifdef MSDSOed save/load routines changed so that wr_unique and
		rd_unique now write/read bytes, not 32bits... CFT
dungeon.c:	  I'm going thru the source files looking for booleans that I can
		change from int's to int8u's.  This'll save some memory.
		I'm only bothering with globals, types, or stuff in good-
		sized arrays.  Once I'm done, I'll have to go back + change
		save.c so it r/w the proper data sizes...  Also, I'll fix
		any extern refs to the variables I change...
	Anyway, changes from dungeon.c:  (inside #ifdef MSDOS)
		good_item_flag, create_up_stair, create_down_stair ==> int8u
main.c:	  peek, be_nasty, all the unique artifact armor + weap flags ==> int8u
	and quests[] ==> int16 (also in #ifdefs)
store2.c:	  is_home ==> int8u (also in #ifdefs)
variable.c
	weapon_heavy, pack_heavy, NO_SAVE, character_generated,
		character_saved, death, default_dir, find_flag,
		wizard, to_be_wizard, rogue_like_commands, free_turn_flag,
		find_cut, find_examine, find_bound, find_prself, 
		prompt_carry_flag, show_weight_flag, highlight_seams,
		find_ignore_doors, doing_inven, screen_change, search_flag,
		teleport_flag, player_light, eof_flag, light_flag,
		wait_for_more, closing_flag, new_level_flag  ALL ===> int8u
		(also in #ifdefs) -CFT
externs.h:	  variables mentioned above that were changed to int8u changed
		to extern int8u...
	ifndef-ed out prototype of sprintf()...  It doesn't match TurboC's,
		so it didn't work... -CFT
undef.c:	  Added ifdef-else-endif to not need sys/file.h, since it doesn't
		seem to come w/ TC.  Also <string.h> included instead of
		<strings.h>	CFT
	
main.c:	  ifndef-ed out gethostname() call and check for load avg.  Unneeded
		on the PC...  -CFT
	ifndef-else-endif clause to avoid getuid() call for msdos -CFT
wizard.c:	  add ifdef MSDOS so that is_wizard always returns true for PC players,
		so they can enter Wiz mode if they want to... -CFT
create.c:	  #if-ed out code to give wizards bonus hp's.  I didn't like it.
		Besides, all PC players are wiz's by is_wizard... -CFT
dungeon.c:	  grabbed code from Um55 dungeon.c to #ifdef call to check_input()
		with call to kbhit()...  -CFT
death.c:	  #ifndef-ed call to fchmod inside print_tomb.  The bones files on
		a PC will be w/r able; since only 1 user...  -CFT
	Earlier #ifndef to avoid call to flock() replaced by #ifdef-#else-
		#endif clause stolen (again) from Um55 src.  It now calls
		fopen where before it did nothing (Hopefully this will
		avoid problems later...) -CFT
dungeon.c:	  Call to random() inside staffs code replaced w/ randint().  I
		wonder why you folks didn't notice?  Perhaps random() is
		a std fn on Unix systems?  -CFT
save.c:	  Call to link(), and some surrounding code #ifndef-ed out.  The
		code seemed to link a new file name to the savefile +
		then unlink the old name.  I doubt this would work well
		on a PC..  -CFT */
spells.c:	  Calls to usleep() replaced by calls to delay() by ifdef-else-endif
		clause.  arg is div by 1000, sice delay works in millisecs,
		not u-secs...  -CFT
externs.h:	  Added #ifdef-ed prototype of dealy().  I didn't see any reason to
		#include the entire <dos.h> file jsut for this.  Maybe I'll
		change my mind later... -CFT
death.c:	  More changes to the file locking code.  The code I stole from Um55
		uses FILE * vars for everything; the Angband code uses file
		desc.'s for everything.  Klugded together by adding local
		FILE * vars (#ifdef-ed), and using fileno macro to get
		file desc. from FILE *.  Wish it luck... -CFT 
config.h:	  Added definition of USING_TCIO, so ms_misc.c will not #include
		curses.  I'll get back to making Angband work with
		curses later.  Right now I just want it to compile.  -CFT
create.c:	  #if 0 out only section of code that uses doubles...  replacement
		code was taken from above; seems to do the same thing, with
		integer math.  I'm trying to avoid flt pt math because
		Angband is too big to run right now... -CFT
spells.c:	  #if 0 out only section of code that uses doubles...  bolt() code
		rewritten (by me, not stolen this time.. :-) to use integer
		math in calculating new positions for angled bolts.  It's
		based on the idea that you can only draw the bolt as
		discrete locations, so I only calc discrete locations.  All
		it decides is whether to change only 1 coordinate, or both
		coordinates at each step.  All changes are by +/- 1.  When
		only 1 changed, it moves in the x or y axis.  When both,
		it moves diagonal.  It should approximate the double code
		quite well...  -CFT
constant.c:	  Bug detected!  cave_type.cptr is an int8u, with range 0-255,
		but it's used in indexing m_list, which had been given
		a big size.  I've trimmed MAX_MALLOC back to 255... -CFT
	Also MAX_TALLOC down to 255, and MAX_SAVE_HIGHSCORES down to 35. -CFT
variable.c:	  Split into two files for MSDOS memory reasons -- cave[][] is most
		of a 64k segment, so I moved it off to it's own file,
		vars2.c.
types.h:	  Changeing MAX_TALLOC to <= 8bits now allows me to change type of
		cave_type.tptr to int8u.  This will save me 12-15 K on the
		size of Angband.  Since it's too big to run just now, I'll
		take the smaller mons/lv limit if it'll help Angband run.
		(Besides, MAX_MALLOC & MAX_TALLOC of 255 is still more than
		what they are in the Um55 sources...)  -CFT
	Also, since fvals used in cave_type.fval only range from 0-15, I'm
		making it into a 4-bit bitfield.  Combining it with the
		4 1-bit bitfields, I should be able to get sizeof(cave_type)
		down to 3.  That should significantly reduce memory usage
		in vars2.c  Unfortunately, all these type changes mean that
		I have to do a massive search+replace to add casts in the
		code. (both type changes inside #ifdef MSDOS)
config.h:	  Added #define of ANGBAND_DESC to hold file name of external
		descriptions file.  I'll detail the format in a bit...
		OK... details:	  	The file has MAX_CREATURES seek pointers,
		followed by the strings.  Just seek to i*sizeof(long), read
		the seek ptr, then seek to it, and read your descript.
EVERYWHERE:	  A lot of constants had L appended to them so TC will treat them as
		32 bit values.  Also a few misc casts added to avoid
		warnings. -CFT
misc2.c:	  Another potential bug.  In teleport(), the test of the while loop
		checks cave[y][x].tptr == OBJ_OPEN_DOOR.  This is wrong.
		What is meant is "t_list[cave[y][x].tptr].index ==
		OBJ_OPEN_DOOR". It has been fixed... -CFT
dungeon.c:	  YA poss bug, in activate, it was passing inventory[i] to known2_p().
	What was needed was &(inventory[i]).  Fixed in 3 places... -CFT
monsters.c:	  Lots of monster exp values had U appended to them, to denote them
		as unsigned values (even Morgoth only had 60,000.. Is that
		per level I wonder?) I didn't append L because declared in
		types.h to be int16u... -CFT
creature.c:	  Bug in Nether ball code... Wierd placement of parathesis was
		confusing my compiler-->  was:	    if (py.flags.nether_resist)
	    breath(GF_MAGIC_MISSILE, char_row, char_col,
	((34+damroll(10,7)+((c_list[m_ptr->mptr].level)*2)/3), ddesc, monptr));
		Now is:					Notice extra paren ^^^
	  if (py.flags.nether_resist)
	    breath(GF_MAGIC_MISSILE, char_row, char_col,
	(34+damroll(10,7)+(c_list[m_ptr->mptr].level*2)/3), ddesc, monptr);

	Also, extra parens inserted in creatures(), during the calculation
		for being noticed...  My compiler bitched -CFT
potions.c:	  In quaff(), parens added around flag expression test.  It was
		something like " blahblah | py.flags.someflag>0 | blahblah".
		Now it is " blahblah | (py.flags.someflag>0) | blahblah".
spells.c:	  In detect_enchantment(), call to special_check() now uses & of
		t_list[...], instead of just t_list[...].
main.c:	  Added if __TURBOC__ -ed external definition of the variable _stklen,
		to increase the default stacksize...
	Added #ifdef MSDOS -ed call to msdos_init, which initializes some of
		the tcio screen procedures, and checks for a angband.cnf file
		to read in some setting.
	Added #ifndef MSDOS around call to umask()
externs.h:	  Added (inside #ifdef MSDOS) prototypes for:  msdos_init().
	Added prototype for init_scorefile()
	Added prototype for init_file()
	"	"	"   user_name()
externs.h:	  Ugly change:  I'm adding #defined constants to allow me to specify
		arg types, to give TC the full prototypes.  If __TURBOC__
		is not defined, these should collapse to nothing. -CFT
	It's not pretty, but it allows me to add all my full prototypes to
		stop my compiler from bitching, and still allows anyone
		who doesn't need full prototypes to use the same set.  I
		could just cut+paste, and have 2 separate sets of prototypes,
		1 with and 1 w/o argument defs, but I have a feeling that
		they'd get out of sync...
moria1.c:	  added parens around potentially ambigious or expression in
		inven_command, where it tests which to see if is a letter
files.c:	  call to magic_treasure() inside print_objects() was missing a couple
		of new arguments.  Right now, I'm passing 0,FALSE for
		good,not_special
dungeon.c:	  Bug in code for ring of power; call to take hit didn't pass descript.
		string...  fixed -CFT
death.c:	  YA bug; clear_screen() takes no args, but in 3 diff places it was
		called as clear_screen(0,0)...  fixed -CFT
staffs.c:	  genocide (from the staff) called w/o the "spell" parameter.
		fixed... -CFT
save.c:	  YA bug.  rd_unique was casting &item->dead to int8u, instead of
		int8u *.  I probably did this one myself.  Fixed -CFT
main.c:	  move call to init_signals to AFTER init_curses, like the comment
		says to do.. -CFT 
main.c:	  added #ifdef MSDOS code to use a savefile name that dos would like -CFT
save.c:	  changed save/restore code (inside #ifdefs) to compesate for the types
		I've changed... -CFT
ALL:	  I'm adding janderso@vtssi.vt.edu 's color code.  He wrote it for
		Umoria 5.5, but I'm confident I can get the basics working.
		Unfortunately, it depends on TurboC's textcolor function,
		and assumes the tcio.c io package, so I'm not sure how
		portable it is to other systems...  I'd like to think
		that it would be relatively easy to write a textcolor
		function for other MSDOS compilers to make it work -- seems
		like all you'd need is a switch to call the appropriate
		code for your system.  With this setup, it might even work
		under ANSI.SYS color codes.  The hitch might be tcio --
		I've no idea how restrictive it is... -CFT
treasure.c:	  janderso's TC_COLOR code detected a problem here (this was a bitch
		to find...)  Most of the entries don't have a value for
		field 'flags2', an int32u.  No problem?  Well, not until I
		add my color data onto the end (inside an #ifdef).  It was
		using my color data as the flag, and then the color got
		(by default) init-ed to 0. -CFT
recall.c:	  preliminary playtesting of my now (apparently) working executable
		showed that unique monsters always reported "No known
		battles to the death are recalled."  This was probably
		done, so that past characters wouldn't affect the message.
		I've changed the code a bit to check u_list[].dead when
		dealing with unique monsters.  Now, after killing Farmer
		Maggot, the mon. memory will report him dead...  (But not
		for a new character using an old memory). -CFT
spells.c:	  YA bug.  In pain_message(), the %age of hp is calculated by
		(100*newhp)/oldhp.  However, it is (very) possible for
		100*newhp to be > 32,767 (max signed 16 bit value).  For
		TurboC, ints are 16 bits, so this causes problems.  (Unhurt
		Iron golum "cries feebly" from 1st magic missle?  Then
		"shrugs off the attack" after many, many magic missiles?)
help.c:	  Added case 'h' to ident_char(), so it won't say "not used" about
		dwarves, elves, hobbits, etc... -CFT
misc2.c:	  BUG!  Somehow, losing int makes me lose ALL spells, instead of
		just the extra ones I earned for int > 18/50.  I should
		lose about 6 or 7, not all 36 that I've learned...
	Okay, what's happened is that whoever added the 2nd int32u spell
		fields was a bit lazy, and just cut+pasted a second copy
		of much of the spell learn/forget code.  Unfortunately, this
		causes it to do wierd things like shift more than 31 places.
		Also, in some of the loops, it could have (and DID, that's
		how I noticed all this...) acted twice, forgetting or
		remebering 2 spells in a single pass of the loop.  This is
		bad if the starting value of the loop var (new_spells) is
		odd, and it is used to test for 0.  What happens is you got
		values of -7,-5,-3,-1,1,3,... for new_spells when forgetting.
		Since it wasn't zero when it was testing, it didn't stop
		until there were no more spells.  I assume an equally bad
		situation could have happened when remembering spells...
	I'm fixing this by rewriting some of the code:  Adding in (j-32)
		when using j as the bit index for the 2nd spell fields;
		Also, I'm having to re-write most of calc_spells().
		Hopefully, that'll be all... -CFT
creatures.c:	  YA BUG!  I was wondering why the monster memory didn't remember a
		lot of things, including that the monster healed itself.
		So I looked around in the recall code and it looked ok.
		Then I tried the mon_cast_spell() code -- it's almost
		right; for spells above 32, you use the proper variables,
		but you still shift by (throw_spell -1), instead of
		(thrown_spell -33) and (thrown_spell -65).
recall.c:	  I put back in the code to use an external description file, instead
		of describe_mon.c, since this is used rarely and eats up
		a lot of space that MSDOS doesn't have to spare.  Even
		my overlay setup doesn't help; the descriptions are all data,
		and I can't overlay that...  (Oh, BTW, it's #ifdef-ed) -CFT
	Also, the file mkdesc.c, compiled and linked into the object file
		describe_mon.obj, should automagically produce the external
		description file used -- no need to do it by hand, even
		if describe_mon.c is changed... -CFT
creature.c:	  Not quite a bug.  One of the possible result of a Nexus breath was
		"stat-scambling".  However the code was swaping current, max,
		AND used stat values.  This causes wierd things to happen if
		your dex + chr (for example) got swapped when you where
		wearing/wielding something that gave you a bonus to dex.
		What should happen is that the current + max get swapped,
		and then the 'used' value is recalculated by calling
		set_use_stat().  This part is fixed.  They way it's written,
		even after my minor fix, there doesn't seem to be anyway to
		recover your old stat values.  Should there be?  Or is this
		an incentive to maximize all your stats?  I'd sure hate to
		be playing a 1/2-Troll priest, and get my Charisma swapped
		with my Wisdom!  -CFT
spells.c:	  Changed bolt() from void to int.  Return value of 1 means the
		bolt hit the player.  Return of 0 means it didn't (probably
		hit another monster).  Used in creature.c to avoid doing
		extra effects if the bolt doesn't even hit the player.
creature.c:	  Changed some code in mon_cast_spell() to check return value from
		bolt() before doing extra effects (ie, don't drain exps
		if nether bolt hits another monster).
creature.c:	  Umber hulks (and probably anyone else who can break walls) did
		wierd things when they walked through a door.  The floor
		value was changed, so the game allowed you to walk through
		the door, but the door was left unchanged.  I've fixed it
		so that the door is now broken, so that walking though it
		is normal. -CFT
prayer.c:	  changed the remove curse spell from in place code which allowed
		the One Ring to be uncursed to a call to remove_curse(),
		which doesn't allow that.  In case you really wanted
		priests to be able to escape the One Ring, the old code
		is still there, inside a #if 0. -CFT
treasure.c and desc.c:	  Weird identify bug found!  Some items (Amulet of DOOM, potion of
		death, etc) that I KNEW I hadn't yet seen were identified
		when I first saw them (ie, not "blue potion" or "titanium
		amulet")  The subvals for some of the scrolls and potions
		cause some collisions (same subval used in both TV_SCROLL1
		and TV_SCROLL2, or TV_POTION1 and TV_POTION2).  Also, the
		subval for remove curse scroll is same as subval for
		*remove curse*, and they're both TV_SCROLL1!  Also, for
		amulets, the code for object_offset() doesn't differentiate
		between them.  The amulet of DOOM had the same subval as
		the rod of disarming, which I had already identified, so
		it was identified.  What's confusing is that the comment
		on OBJECT_IDENT_SIZE in constant.h says that object_offset()
		was rewritten to handle rods...
constant.h:	  The value of OBJECT_IDENT_SIZE was 1024, but the comment said it
		was 8*64.  By my math, that's only 512...  Unfortunately,
		this is used in the savefile, so changing it makes the
		save files uncompatible.  I'm going to leave it as it is
		for now, but I thought I should make a note of it. -CFT
misc1.c:	  Added casts to values in max_hp(), in hope of curing a weird bug.
		Monsters who heal themselves, even if unhurt, seem to
		then have 0 hps... To be honest, I'm not sure this is
		where the problem is... I haven't been able to repeat the
		problem while playing around in Wiz mode on the old code.
		But an extra cast can't hurt... -CFT
recall.c:	  YA dos trouble.  Again it the 16bit int problem...  When showing
		the experience for Morgoroth (from Wiz mode), he's only
		worth about 16k for a 39th character -- obviously it's
		wrapping around 0.  I'm going to take a look and make sure
		that the experience given also doesn't wrap around 0... -CFT
	(Exp given was fine -CFT)
recall.c:	  YA wierd problem found.  In recall code, when printing the "for a
		15th level character" message, some fancy code was used to
		choose proper suffix for number and "a" or "an".  Anyway,
		it wasn't printing properly.  I tracked it down to a
		"%d" instead of "%ld" in a sprintf call.  I searched
		through the rest of the source, and I didn't see any other
		suspicious "%d"s.  Of course, this problem wouldn't happen
		on machines w/ 32bit ints. -CFT
death.c:	  I finally figured out why the highscore table was (somethimes) being
		printed with garbage.  The "hugebuffer" variable really was
		huge -- 10,000 bytes.  It was overflowing my poor 12k stack.
		I've trimmed hugebuffer down to 1k, and slightly modified
		the sprintf()s in display_scores() so that large buffers are
		no longer neccessary.  In fact, I probably could junk
		hugebuffer altogether, merely sprintf()ing into the lines[]
		array, but I wanted to minimize my changes.
dungeon.c:	  Wizard mode '*' command was unlighting map, not lighting it.  I
		changed call from wizard_light(FALSE) to wizard_light(TRUE).
		Seems to have fixed it... -CFT
	Also, I changed the sub-shell message (in a #ifdef) to let DOS users
		know that the reason they can't shell out of Angband is not
		because I don't want to let them, but because there's no
		free memory for a subshell.
moria2.c:	  Bug found in fix2_delete_mon().  It was passing a c_list pointer to
		check_unique(), instead of a m_list ptr. -CFT
recall.c:	  Minor change to code that checks CM_SPECIAL for various special
		movements, so put in a check for BREAK_WALL in rcdefense.
		I wanted to remember that Umber Hulks, Black Reavers, etc
		are unstoppable... -CFT
	Tiny bug found... rcdefense was declared as int16u, but c_recall[]
		used int32u.  I didn't notice until it didn't show any
		mention of BREAK_WALL (which is in the high end of the
		longword...) -CFT
creature.c:	  To make it remember that a monster (Nexus Q's, for example) can
		teleport you away, I changed a tiny bit of code at the
		end of mon_cast_spell().  It used to only update c_recall
		if the monster was lit (basically, if we could see it).  But
		when we get teleported away, or lv teleported, the monster
		might no longer be lit.  To avoid this, it will update 
		c_recall if monster lit, or either of these spells cast.
moria1.c:	  minor change to inven_command, line 1075 (when I chaged it, it might
		get pushed up/down...) to change if statement controling
		"wearing" vs. "wielding" mesg.  It was comparing slot ==
		INVEN_HEAD.  That didn't seem right, so I made it INVEN_WIELD.
sets.c:	  set code changed to accept inven_type pointer instead of tval for
		various "should we destroy this type of object?" set fns.
		Affected were:  set_corrodes(), set_flammable(),
		set_frost_destroy(), set_acid_affect(),
		set_lightning_destroy(), set_acid_destroy(), set_null() and
		set_fire_destroy().  The idea is that these fns should
		check to see if the potentially destroyed item resists that
		type of damage (ie, RA shield in inventory shouldn't be
		lost by an acid attack), or if it's an artifact.  Now I'm
		going to go through misc2.c and spells.c to fix up calls
		to these fns...  -CFT
misc2.c:	  changed inven_damage() to use new item set fn format.
spells.c:	  changed get_flags (inside #ifdef MSDOS) to add arg in definition
		of parameter destroy.
constant.h:	  TR_ARTIFACT is used to indicate that an object is ACTIVATE-able???
		This is so blatently counter-intuitive that I'm changing
		it (well, renaming it, 0x800L in flags2 will still mean
		activateable) to TR_ACTIVATE.  I'm grabbing 0x2000000L (the
		next free flag) in flags2 to be TR_ARTIFACT.  This TR_ARTIFACT
		will mean "this item is an artifact", and will be used, among
		other ways, to prevent artifacts from being casually picked
		up/burned/corroded/frozed/zapped/otherwise eliminated.
	To make this change work, I'm also changing dungeon.c & misc1.c,
		where they used TR_ARTIFACT.  -CFT
dungeon.c:	  search + replace of TR_ARTIFACT with TR_ACTIVATE -CFT
misc1.c:	  search + replace of TR_ARTIFACT with TR_ACTIVATE -CFT
	afterwards, TR_ARTIFACT or-ed into all artifacts created in file...
treasure.c:	  artifacts in treasure list have had 0x02000000 (my new TR_ARTIFACT)
		put into their flags2 value.
moria2.c:	  For completeness, grond + crown of morgoth both have TR_ARTIFACT
		or-ed into their flags2 field...
dungeon.c:	  if statement added into dungeon() code when create_up_stair or
		create_down_stair processed.  Now it shouldn't overwrite
		artifacts. -CFT
spells.c:	  create_doors(), create_traps(), create_stair() changed to check to
		see if obj on floor is an artifact.  If it is, they don't
		call delete_object to get rid of it. -CFT
	minor change: cflag parameter of banish_creature() changed from
		int to int32u
externs.h:	  1st parameter of banish_creature now has int32u in prototype..
	Earlier change of various set functions now reflected in prototypes
spells.c:	  get_flags() parameter harm_type changed from int * to int32u *.
		Also calling fns changed to pass &int32u instead of &int.
externs.h:	  This change also reflected in prototypes..
store2.h:	  types of a couple haggle variables changed from int to int32, to
		avoid "conversion may lose sig. digits" warning. -CFT
misc1.c:	  compact_objects changed so that it will not compact artifacts.
moria2.c:	  quest stairway placement modified so not to clobber any artifact the
		monster might have been standing on...  It performs a random
		walk from monster's location until it finds a spot that
		is open floor AND doesn't contain an artifact.  If it
		contains an object, it is deleted, and then the stair is
		placed there.  The original code seemed flakey, in that
		it checked for object at monster location, and then, if there
		was, it would delete from under player's feet before putting
		the stairway where the monster was...
spells.c:	  build_wall code changed a bit to avoid burying artifacts.  I
		rearranged the code so it check to see if there's a monster,
		handles damage/etc and then looks for possible object to
		delete.  This allows me to use a continue if the object
		is an artifact, which skips deletion + placement of the
		magma block.
	also earthquake code changed to avoid erasing artifacts; almost
		the same trick used.
creature.c:	  creature pick-up code in make_move() changed to not pick up artifacts
	also shatterquake() altered to not erase artifacts.
	also steal object code modified to check for artifact before
		stealing...
store2.c:	  Ah-HA!  I think I found the last int32/int problem in haggle code
		that was preventing you from simply hitting return to
		accept a final offer if > 32k  (note my flag to turn off
		haggling, otherwise this would never happen).  get_haggle()
		parameter price was an int, now an int32... -CFT
	That'll teach me not to speak too soon.  In store_sell(), local
		vars cost, real were ints.  They're now int32's.  Hopefully
		this time it's really the last ones... -CFT
desc.c:	  Ok, I'm going after the ID bug.  Firstly, object_offset() now
		returns a different value for rods than it does for amulets.
		(amulets still 1, rods now 7). -CFT
treasure.c:	  Part 2, now fix up colliding subvals in treasure list:	  	scroll of *remove curse* changed from subval 68 (same subval
			as normal remove curse) to 76, which was unused.
		potion of *elightenment* from subval 80 -> 94
		potion of detonations from sv 81 -> 97
		potion of death from sv 82 -> 109
		potion of life from sv 83 -> 110
		potion of augmentation from sv 84 -> 111
		potion of ruination from sv 85 -> 112
		potion of enlightenment from sv 86 -> 113
		potion of self knowledge from sv 87 -> 114 (still inside
			comment, this is just a defensive measure)
	This, together with the previous change, will probably give me a
		wierd set of id'ed + un-id'ed objects in my current savefile,
		but it should put this problem to rest... -CFT
creature.c:	  mon_cast_spell changed (again) so that monsters w/ 0 for max hp
		have their max hp re-calculated + reset.  If this causes
		pointer problems, maybe it'll help us figure WHAT is causing
		maxhp to get zeroed in the 1st place...
recall.c:	  recall code cleaned up a bit -- minor change in code for natural/
		undead/evil monsters; was if {} else if {} else if...
		Now it is just a bunch of ifs, since these qualities are
		not mutually exclusive...
	Also, I'm adding slightly faster learning of ac/hp/attack damage
		for unqiue monsters, since you don't have the chance to
		kill 200 of them...  (still need to kill more than once,
		so unless you reuse monster memories, you'll never get this
		info)
creature.c:	  The infravision code in update_mon() was screwy... It showed the
		proper monsters, but it only OR-ed NO_INFRA into mon.
		memory if the monster didn't have NO_INFRA!  I think this
		may have been an oversight caused by changing infravision
		from default off (in Um5.*) to infravision on by default
		in Angband.  Anyway, now it will only OR NO_INFRA into mon.
		memory if the monster has NO_INFRA.  (BTW, the reason it
		didn't cause monsters to be listed as "cold blooded" before
		is the memory cdefenese is ANDed with the real cdefense, so
		the mistaken values were eliminated...)
spells.c:	  BUG! in teleport_to code...  It did no bounds checking on y,x before
		using cave[y][x].  I had a sudden crash when a blink dog
		commanded me to return.  The surrounding area was a narrow
		corridor, all full of blink dogs, and near the top of the
		screen.  I assume what happened is that dis increased until
		it tried to use cave[][] with a negative index.  I put in
		a couple of bounds checks... -CFT
create.c:	  A couple of minor changes... when calculating player_hp[], it
		was using MAX_PLAYER_LV*3/8 and MAX_PLAYER_LV*5/8, which
		don't give very good values.  I've put off the division
		until the final step, which gives better results (no lost
		precision in mid-calculation).  Also, in the percent
		calculations to show wizards how the life rating was,
		player_hp[MAX_PLAYER_LV-1]*200 is calc-ed, then divided to
		get the percentage.  For PCs with 16bit ints, this rolls
		over, so I casted to long in mid calc, then back to int
		afterwards.
magic/dungeon.c/moria1.c:	  Fixed mystic shield by changing how it works.  It used to add to
		player's base ac.  This caused mana troubles because mana
		is penalized for high base ac (to simulate encumberence).
		Now it adds to the players magical ac (which seems more
		reasonable for "mystic shield" anyways...)
dungeon.c/moria1.c:	  dungeon() code and calc_bonuses() code were inconsistant.  Heroism
		and S. heroism had apperently been changed in dungeon(),
		but not in calc_bonuses().  This is fixed.  Also,
		calc_bonuses() didn't adjust for stun, so a call to it
		could result in wierd values for +tohit and +todam...  This
		should be fixed.  Also, the stun code in dungeon() looked
		bad.  I'm not really sure it was wrong, but it was nasty.
		So it's been replaced with what I hope is better code.  If
		I've covered everything, then calling calc_bonuses() when
		nothing has changed (no spells timed out, no new stuff worn/
		removed, etc) should give the same values as dungeon() had
		already calculated.  Mystic shield and stun are turned off
		in dungeon, but turned on elsewhere (calc_bonuses() and
		stun_player(), respectively), but they should work.  I'm
		going to test this bit some tonight.
	Oh, the changed stun code should eliminate permanent stun effects,
		which were possible with the old stun code -- if you had
		a really low (like 3 or 4) constitution.  Now stun is
		reduced by at least 1 per round.  If this seems to fast
		to you for people with bad stats, change the 1 in the ?:	  	expression into a ((turn % x) == 0) expression, for some
		value x.  But I think a character with a 3 con has enough
		problems, with his minimal hps...
dungeon.c:	  minor change to transient effects that alter ac (invul, bless, etc).
		now set PY_ARMOR in py.flags.status to have display updated
		AFTER all adjustments handled.  Cannot just call prt_pac()
		because dis_ac isn't adjusted until the end of the trans.
		effects (mostly because I didn't want to add a whole bunch
		of py.misc.dis_ac += something; lines....)  Should display
		correctly now...
creature.c:	  quick change into attack code in make_attack(), adding flag "blinked"
		to prevent continued attacks if a monster has blinked away
		(which may happen after a steal attack).  This wasn't a
		problem for UMoria, because all monsters that stole had the
		steal attack as their last attack; but Smeagol, Harowen,
		and maybe others can have several steal attacks.
	update_mon() changed to allow infravision to see invisible monsters
		(only if they show up on infra-red!).  This test moved before
		the test for player light and see-inv.  The result of this is
		that lighting a torch doesn't prevent your infravision from
		working, which is questionable, but using the Phial of
		Galadrial (which I assume is not a "hot" light source)
		shouldn't interfere with infravision.  So we let infravis
		work even with a torch, so that it will work with the Phial
		and other light sources...
dungeon.c:	  light code changed to test for perm light.  If true, then
		it doesn't decrement p1.  This should cure the Arkenstone
		bugs.  (Note: torches will still be used up, even if wielding
		Ringil or other light-producing equipment... which is what
		should happen)
magic.c / prayer.c:	  cast spell code was using if (randint(100) < chance) to test for
		failure.  But randint returns 1-100, so if chance was 1,
		this was if (1-100 < 1), which was never true!  I've changed
		this from < to <= to make chance of 1 give a 1% failure
		rate, instead of 0%....
misc2.c:	  spell_chance() changed to calculate minfail chance based upon your
		spell stat.  Only mages/priests are allowed to go below
		5% failure, since they are "pure" spellcasters.  The numbers
		in the switch are subject to change if I don't like them...
tables.c:	  store onwers should not have min_inflate over 200, unless they
		never pay more that 1 gp for items when player sells.  For
		now, I've changed all black markets from min_inflate of
		220 to 190.  This means that they will pay about 10% of
		what the item's worth.
store2.c:	  cast added into calulation of min_buy in sell_haggle().  Also,
		I took out the line that divided the price the balck market
		would pay by 4.  See above chance to learn why...
monsters.c:	  gave all non-warrior dark elves the power to cast darkness, and all
		dark elves are now hurt by light (ala Drow).
spells.c:	  "colorized" the code for detection(), so that monster will show up
		in color.  I must have missed this before. -CFT
===========================================================================
The following changes are after I sent sources to Sean Marsh... (orignally)
===========================================================================
death.c:	  Found the frigging hiscore bug!  It wrote the highscore tables in
		binary mode, but in display_scores(), it read them in
		the default mode, which is text mode.  So, when it read
		a CRLF pair, it removed the CR.  This caused the data
		to get out of alignment with the high_scores structure,
		so I was getting wierd results...  (The CRLF's were only
		in the file because they were garbage which happened to
		be on the stack, which ended up in score.name and
		score.died_from, after the null character...  This made the
		problem REAL hard to find, until I started doing hex dumps
		(to a debugging file) of the data as read, and comparing it
		to the hex dump of the highscore file...  0a 0d became just
		0a.  Then I realized what was happening)
death.c:	  Took out hugebuffer[] from display_scores()...  It now sprintf()s
		the strings directly into list[][].  The sprintf()s all
		have field lengths, so they shouldn't overflow the 128 char
		size of each list[i]. -CFT

spells.c:	  Added TR_CURSED and TR_TUNNEL to self-knowledge code in weapon
		description.
misc1.c:	  fixed Shield of Thorin; moved TR_IM_ACID to flags2...  In flags it
		was granting stealth -- an unusual thing for a dwarven item
		to do.
dungeon.c:	  increased the required rating to get "you feel lucky" type message,
		so that the lesser messages are worthwhile, and the best
		ones are not to be missed...
===========================================================================
Changes above here made it into the initial release of Angband
