  Okay folks, until a real Angband FAQ file is built, here's a lot of
info to try to cut down on traffic on rec.games.moria.  I've tried to
organize it loosely into categories.  Some of the information contained
below is definately "Spoilers", so read on at risk of your own thrill of
discovery...

	Where to get Angband
* For anyone looking to get the game, it's available for anonymous ftp
  from ftp.cis.ksu.edu  The Unix source is in pub/Games/Moria/Angband and
  the PC source and executable are in pub/Games/Moria/Angband/PC.

	Ports
* There have been ports to several platforms announced recently.  I've
  seen an announcement for Amiga and Atari ST ports.  I don't know
  where they are available, but ksu would be a good place to start
  looking.  None of the information below is specific to these versions,
  although the general information should still apply.

	Public Service Announcement
* When posting a message to rec.games.moria about something that relates
  to Angband, please include the word 'Angband' in your subject.  If
  your posting is specific to some version of angband, try to mention
  that as well.  For example, if you're asking a question about PC
  Angband, put 'Angband (PC)' in the subject.  This simple courtesy will
  be greatly appreciated by all the moria fans on rec.games.moria. 
  After all, the group is primarily for Moria, and offshoots like
  Angband, Morgul, Druid Moria, etc. are secondary.

	Warning!
* Don't cast the 'create stair' spell on the town level, and go UP.
  It will confuse the Word of Recall scroll badly.  For more info,
  see "Bugs", below.

	Artifacts
* Artifacts don't appear in stores (unless you sell it to them).
* The artifact list in the angband.doc file is incomplete ON PURPOSE.
  It's only meant to tell you a little info about some "legendary" items.
* In some places, the artifact description is (slightly) wrong.  This
  reflects the "legend and rumor" basis for the descriptions (It also
  reflects the fact that the angband.doc file is slightly out-of-date).
* Unique items, once missed, are gone forever...  If you get a "special"
  message, I suggest you use that Staff of Trap Detection, so you don't
  fall through a pit!
* Unique items should resist destruction by fire/frost/lightning/etc, and
  shouldn't be picked up by monsters, so you don't have to worry too much
  about some *&%&^ing green glutton ghost picking up an awesome item.
  Ditto with thieves stealing them...
* Artifacts CAN appear on a level that doesn't give you the "special"
  message.  The "special" message only lets you know if there is an artifact
  (or other special feature) on the level when it's first generated.  If a
  monster is killed and drops an artifact, the only way you'll know about it
  is to ID it (or carry it a while, and hope for the "pseudo-ID" to tell you).
  However, if there is an artifact on the level at the time of creation, you
  will get the "special" message (see below on feelings, though).
* Many (but not all!) artifact weapons can be identified as artifacts
  just by looking at them, because they do non-standard damage.  For
  example, if you see a longsword (normally does 2d5), that says 4d5, you
  know it's an artifact.  (In fact, it's Ringil, the best weapon in the
  game.) 

	Feelings
* About "special about this level", or "good feeling", or "luck is turning",
  etc messages:  You will only get them when you enter a level IF you've
  been on the previous 2 levels "long enough".  This is to prevent people
  from standing on a stairway, and going up and down until they get a
  "special" message.  "Long enough" is a couple hundred turns or so, if
  I remember right.  This means that the 1st time you go to 50' into
  dungeon, you will never get a message, because you can't have been on
  the previous TWO levels yet.
* Another note on the "something special about this level" message: 
  There are three things that could cause it... Artifacts, monster pits,
  and player ghosts.  As you get deeper in the dungeon, the game
  considers monster pits to be less special.  At 2500', only 1 pit in 5
  or 6 is likely to trigger a "special" message.  So there is no
  guarantee that you can stop looking for an artifact just because you
  found a monster pit.  In fact, a monster pit, or a player ghost, or
  an artifact on the level doesn't prevent another artifact from
  appearing on the level, although the odds are slim at shallow depths.
* The other "feelings" you can get relate to the general 'rating' of the
  level.  Many things can contribute to the 'rating' of a level:  Out
  of depth monsters, out of depth items, some excellent items (DF, HA,
  of Westernesse, RA, R, etc), and special rooms (vaults, round rooms,
  giant vaults, etc).  If you get one of these messages, you should be
  fairly careful, in case there's some out of depth monsters around, but
  you should also try to grab everything you can, in hopes of getting
  some better items.
 
	Spellcasting
* All spellcasters are penalized for high ACs.  This is based on true AC,
  w/o any magical bonuses.  This simulates the general encumbering effects
  of heavy armor.
* Mages, and other mage-type spell caster, lose mana for wearing gloves (or
  gauntlets or cestus).  This simulates the interference they cause with
  the intricate gestures required for spellcasting.  Priests and paladins
  don't have this problem, as they invoke the power of their diety...
* The minimum spell failure chance depends both on your class and on
  your spell stat.  Only pure spellcasters (mage and priest) can get
  really low failure rates.
* Many duration spells don't provide much duration if cast again while the
  effects still last.  For example, casting haste self 10 times in a row
  isn't a very good use of mana...
* There are 9 spells books for mages, and 9 for priests.  The new 5
  books can be found deeper in the dungeon.  Or you could get lucky and
  see them at the Black Market.  These books are not artifacts. 
* Monster spell resistances have been changed from Moria...  In Moria, a
  white dragon took extra damage from a fire bolt/ball, and partial
  (1/4th) damage from a frost bolt/ball.  In Angband, a white dragon
  takes normal damage from a fire bolt/ball, and almost no (1/9th)
  damage from a frost bolt/ball.  Basically, there are no more
  "susceptibilities".  There are a couple of exceptions to this...
  Monsters can be susceptible to bright light (ie, wand of light, not
  lightning), and holy orb does extra damage vs evil AND less damage
  against non-evil creatures (It never does 'normal' damage, which seems
  a bit weird to me, but...).
* Many of the mage spells are now adjusted by your level.  However, a
  lot more monsters are immune to frost/fire/lightning, so either you
  need a LOT of magic missiles, or haste up and hack-n-slash...
* Priests and paladins now need the right prayer book to learn spells. 
  In Moria, they didn't. (Moria did it that way to prevent players from
  dropping all but the 3rd book to "force" Orb of Draining.)  Angband does
  it this way so that the new spells in the extra books wouldn't be
  given to a low level character (who then couldn't cast it until he
  journeys deep in the dungeon and finds the right book).  This means you
  can "force" the spells you want, if you drop all but 1 book at home
  before learning new spells.  (Don't forget to pick the books up again
  afterwards!  I lost a half-troll priest to a bunch of water trolls,
  since he forgot the book with 'portal' in it!)
* "You seem to be missing a book" means that you have the capacity to
   learn more spells than you happen to have available to you at the
   moment.  This might mean that you are level 50, and already know all
   the spells, but could learn more if there were any.  It might mean
   that you are a 6th level rogue, who could learn a second spell, but
   the normal books only have one spell below level 7.  (In this case,
   you really are missing a book).  The wording of the message may be
   a little confusing, but, to be honest, I can't think of a relatively
   short message that applies to both situations and sounds good.

	Combat
* Group monster can be DANGEROUS!  Even if you can kill a single orc/
  troll/novice whatever/whatever hound/etc without too much trouble,
  it's easy to get overwhelmed by sheer numbers.  My advice: Make sure
  only 1 can attack you at a time, and for any spell-casting or
  breathing groups, ambush them from around a corner so that only 1 can
  see you at a time.  A possible exception to this is novice rangers;
  they can only cast magic missile, and missile spells (as opposed to
  ball spells or breath weapons) cannot "jump" other monsters in
  Angband.  So, if you're having trouble with novice rangers, get them
  all lined up in a corridor, and then some of them will be wounded/
  killed by M.M.s from other rangers.  Of course, you don't get
  experience for anything that you don't kill, but you might survive
  a bit longer...
* Another major piece of advice is that you should always try to carry
  some cure serious wound (or better) potions (to cure some HPs, and
  remove blindness and confusion).  This will allow spell casters to
  cast their escape spells, and allow others to read their escape
  scrolls.  Scrolls of phase door or teleport are important for
  characters who don't have an escape spell.  Staves of teleportation
  work also, but a thief can only steal 1 scroll at a time, or a fire
  trap can only burn up 1 scroll at a time...  On the other hand, you
  can use a staff while blinded and confused.
* Damage from "ego" weapons/artifacts is calculated as follows:
  damage = ((base weapon damage "rolled") * weap_mult) * hit_mult +
	  hit_bonus + +to-dam
  weap_mult is the bonuses granted for the weapon.  hit_mult is the
  multiplier granted from a "good", "excellent", etc hit.  hit_bonus is
  the additional damage granted from a "good", etc hit.  +to-dam is the
  character's total pluses to damage.

  Note that damage bonuses are not multiplied in.  This means that a
  dagger (1d4), even if it does x5 damage, is not as good as a two-handed
  sword (3d6) that does x2 damage, unless you get more swings with the
  dagger.  Of course, if the T-H-sword had +0 to damage, and the dagger
  had +20 to damage, you might want to use the dagger anyways.

  There is an exception to the above equation:  slings/bows/Xbows when
  used in conjunction with the appropriate ammo.  This helps warriors
  survive without spells.  For "bows" with the correct ammo, the formula
  is:
  damage = (base ammo damage "roll" + +to-dam-ammo + +to-dam-"bow")
	   * "bow"_mult * ammo_mult * hit_mult + hit_bonus
  "bow"_mult is the multiplier with the missile launcher.  ammo_mult is
  for special ammos -- of Fire, of Dragon Slaying, etc.  hit_mult is the
  multiplier gained from a "good",etc hit.  hit_bonus is the extra
  damage gained from a "good",etc hit.

  Note that, in this case, damage bonuses ARE multiplied.  This makes a
  heavy crossbow (x4) with a high +to-dam very powerful... If you have
  some bolts.
* Multiplers for various weapon powers are:
	L   -  x5	XD  -  x5	FB  -  x3	FT  -  x3
	SD  -  x3	SDm -  x3	SU  -  x3	SO  -  x3
	SG  -  x3	ST  -  x3	SE  -  x2	SA  -  x2
  Abbreviations used above are: (self knowledge mesg. in parenthesis)
    L   - Lightning, unless res. ("electrocutes your foes")
    XD  - Execute Dragon ("great bane of dragons")
    FB  - Frost (Brand), unless res. ("freezes your foes")
    FT  - Flame (Tongue), unless res. ("burns your foes")
    SD  - Slay Dragon ("especially deadly against dragons")
	NOTE: SD is x3 in Angband, not x4 like it was in Moria...
    SDm - Slay Demon ("strikes at demons with holy wrath")
    SU  - Slay Undead ("strikes at undead with holy wrath")
    SO  - Slay Orcs ("especially deadly against orcs")
    SG  - Slay Giants ("especially deadly against giants")
    ST  - Slay Trolls ("especially deadly against trolls")
    SE  - Slay Evil ("fights against evil with holy fury")
    SA  - Slay Animals ("especially deadly against Nature's creatures")
  Note that only the highest applicable multiplier is used, if several
  apply.  For example, a weapon with XD, SU, SE used against a Dracolich
  will only do the x5 from XD, NOT x5x3x2 == x30 from all three.
* Damage bonues for special hits are:
  "good hit"		x2 + 5
  "execellent hit"	x2 + 10
  "superb hit"		x3 + 15
  "*GREAT* hit"		x3 + 20
  The odds of getting a special hit are influenced by your pluses to
  hit, your combat skill, and the weight of your weapon (Heavier weapons
  are more likely to deliver an extra-hard hit).
* Priests are penalized for weilding "non-priestly" weapons.  This
  penalty comes from D&D.  Priests are basically restricted to maces,
  clubs, and other blunt weapons.   They should get a message ("You are
  not comfortable with your weapon" or something like that) if they
  wield a non-priestly weapon.  But this is a relatively minor
  penalty...  If you find Ringil, WIELD IT!
* For those who have examined the "blows" table (which tells how many
  swings you can get, based on your strength, your dex, and the weight
  of your weapon), be warned:  When calculating your STR to weapon
  weight ratio, the code considers any weapon lighter than 5 pounds to
  weigh 5 pounds.  So there is no longer any advantage gained by
  weilding really light weapons (ie a Stilleto no longer gives two
  swings even to a character with moderate stats.)

	General
* You don't get any extra speed from wearing a second speed ring.  You
  can still get extra speed by wearing a speed ring with some other
  source of speed, like boots of speed.  This is not a bug.
* If you kill Sauron out-of-depth (not on level 99 (4950')), then you
  will have to fall through a trap door to get beyond level 99.  This
  is a bug, caused by an oversight in the quest code.  Sorry, folks...

  This has been fixed in the new PC update, and I've sent the changes
  to Sean Marsh, so it should not be a problem too much longer.
* There is now a Potion of Self Knowledge, much like the potion from
  Nethack, which can tell you what your resistances etc. are.  With
  judicious use of these potions, you should be able to tell what powers
  various artifacts grant you.  This should reduce people's reliance on
  spoilers to decide which of 2 weapons, or 2 armors, etc. to use.
* Farmer Maggot CAN be killed.  Just hit him a lot...
* Infravision allows you to see SOME invisible monsters (if they aren't
  cold-blooded).  This is not a bug.
* Weapons "of Flame" are (FT).  "of Frost" is (FB).  "of Fire" does x3 fire
  damage like a (FT), but doesn't give you fire resistance.
* Orcs and trolls can be fun to line up in a long corridor, and then
  blast with a wand of light!  (Not all types are susceptible...)
* Unique monsters, once missed, come back again (until killed).  If you are
  having a LOT of trouble with one of them, run and read a WoR scroll.  Maybe
  he won't be on the level next time...  You can kill him later, when you're
  tougher.  I especially recommend this with "Mim, betrayer of Turin" for
  mages...  (You'll see why  :-)
* Some advice on identifying items:  How you go about it depends on your
  class and level.  For warriors, paladins and rogues, carry everything
  you find (weapons + armor; this doesn't work for potions, etc) for a
  while.  Your 'pseudo-identify' should kick in and give you some idea
  how good/bad the item is.  For anyone with the 'remove curse' spell,
  try on any armor you find.  If it's cursed, uncurse it, and drop it.
  That way you don't have to carry cursed items at least.  But DO NOT
  do this with weapons.  There are some really bad weapons that can
  laugh off your feeble attempts to uncurse!  For mages and rangers
  who have the identify spell and know it well enough to cast fairly
  often, ID everything you can.  If you've got some really nice Mithral
  Plate, you don't have to ID things like studded leather armor, but you
  should try to get everything you can.  Besides, you should be on the
  lookout for light armor artifacts, to avoid the mana penalty of heavy
  armor.  For priests, and low levels mages and rangers, you have to
  depend on ID scrolls, staves of perceptions, etc.  Even priests do get
  some feeling of 'cursed' items if they carry things long enough.  Try
  not to waste ID spells on cursed items.  At high levels, priests can
  get the ID spell, but it's in one of the deeper books.
* Damage messages when you cast a spell, or fire a missile, are
  dependant on the amount of damage done relative to the current HPs of
  the monster.  There are a number of messages, depending on how
  severe the attack was, and on what type of monster it is (for example,
  monsters without mouths don't "scream in pain", they "draw back in
  pain").  Note that throwing many items (like food rations) does NO
  DAMAGE and, for PC people, can cause trouble (see "guardian angel"
  below, in the "Bugs" section).
* The monster memory does show more than one description for some
  monsters.  Some examples are filthy street urchins, novice mages/
  priests/wariors/rangers, mimics, gnome mages, ethereal hounds, etc.
  There are two or more entries because there are actually two or more
  different types of these monsters.  Often the difference between them
  is that one is found solo and the other is found in groups, at a
  slightly deeper level.
* Also note that the monster memory doesn't give you credit for killing
  a monster if you cannot see the monster (if you are blind, or the
  monster is in a dark area beyond your infravision range, etc).  The
  recall code for uniques is slightly different, and the monster memory
  will note their deaths even if you never saw them.
* To use rods with the "non-rogue" command set, use the 'z' key.  This
  IS documented in the help screen, but it doesn't fit on the first
  screen.  If you hit ESC instead of space, you'll never see the second
  (and following) help screens, so you wouldn't know this.
* Monster "vaults", or whatever you prefer to call the unusual rooms
  with lots of monsters, unusual size/shape/both, are dangerous.  They
  often have some very nice out-of-depth items, but they also include
  some very nasty out-of-depth monsters.  Some "vaults" have walls that
  are made of impenetratible rock, but don't worry.  Somewhere there
  will be a way in, even if it's a granite wall that you have to dig
  through (Usually near the corners).  "Monster vaults" (as opposed to
  "monster pits") do not cause a "special" feeling, but they do greatly
  improve the 'rating' of the level, so you will often get some form of
  "your luck is turning" message.  Of course, if the "vault" happens to
  contain an artifact, you should get the "special" message as usual.

	PC specific
* There is now a second update uploaded to ftp.cis.ksu.edu:
  'angexe12.exe' and 'angsrc12.exe' for the executable and source
  files.  Both of these are self-extracting .zip archives.  Be sure
  to get them in BINARY mode!

  The new update includes: look command to see how hurt a monster is,
  rod of trap location (to help warriors), updated monster descriptions,
  highscore table will no longer show wizards, highscore delete fixed,
  quest code fixed so that killing Sauron out-of-depth doesn't cause
  problems getting past level 99, auto-roller option, player score
  highlighted on death/retirement (color only), file character
  description on death/retirement, summoned group monsters are now ALL
  properly lit when summoned, entering shops fixed for people who use
  'g' key for pickup, *Enlighenment* now also grants self-knowledge, and
  many minor changes and bug fixes.
* For PC people: If you still use the original release, GET ONE OF
  THE UPDATES! ('angexe11.exe', 'angexe12.exe' or 'angsrc12.exe' at
  ksu)  I'm not kidding...  There is a serious bug in the original
  executable which can harm your system.  (See next, and under "Bugs")
* For PC people, the "tombstone" bug has been fixed.  Get one of the
  updates from ftp.cis.ksu.edu in pub/Games/Moria/Angband/PC if you
  haven't already done so.  The "tombstone" bug was caused by
  overflowing the stack, which could have (possibly) messed up your
  system.
* For PC people: If you're planning on compiling your own Angband, or
  have already done so, get the updated sources ('angsrc12.exe' on ksu).
  Don't use the old sources, which still contain the "stack overflow"
  bug.
* PC users: "Abnormal program termination" means that you do not have enough
  free memory to load angband.  "Out of memory in init_curses()" means
  you have just enough memory to load Angband, but not quite enough to
  run it (It needs some extra space for some variables).  Try to free up
  as much memory as possible.  If you need help doing so, the file
  'free-mem.doc' that was packaged with the updated executable should
  give you some ideas.
* For PC users:  My estimate of the minimum memory required to run
  Angband is 500-505k.  Please note that when I say 505k, I mean 517,120
  bytes, not 505,000 bytes.  This estimate was obtained during my
  playtesting of the updated executable, using DOS's 'mem' command, from
  the "largest executable program size" line.
* For PC users:  To specify the name of your savefile at the command
  line, just type 'Angband savefilename'...  No '-u' switch is needed.
* For PC users (and maybe Unix also, I'm not sure):  There IS a way to turn
  off haggling (compiled into the PC executable).  Just use the '=' command
  to get to the options menu.
* For PC users with monochrome monitors:  You can now turn off color from
  the options menu (use the '=' key to get to it).
* For PC users:  The mon_desc.dat file has a minor error in it which
  causes the description for the 1st monster (Filthy street urchin) to
  have the 1st 4 letters as gibberish.  I've fixed this, and fixed
  many spelling/grammar errors in the description file.  If you want
  to, you can get the corrected file 'mon_desc.dat' from KSU.  It's in
  pub/Games/Moria/Angband/PC/patches.  Just replace the old mon_desc.dat
  file with the new one.  This is a minor fix, though.  If you don't
  care about a few spelling errors, you don't have to get the file.
  If you've got the new update 'angexe12.exe', then you already have the
  corrected description file.
  
	Bugs
  (As far as the PC executable goes, most of these are fixed in the new
   update.  I included them here anyways to help people who may not be
   using the most current version.  If it says "This should be fixed",
   then the new update fixes it, and I've sent the fix to Sean Marsh.
   -CFT)
* The high score table will currently allow ex-wizards to show up.  This
  isn't too bad of a problem on unix systems, because you have to be on
  the wiz list to enter wizard mode.  But on PCs, anyone can enter wiz
  mode.  Of course, the only person likely to see the high score list on
  a PC is the user of that PC, so this also isn't such a big deal.  This
  should be fixed.
* Mages/rangers/rogues can cast the 'create stair' spell and clobber the
  entrance to a store.  Also, you could create an upstairway from town,
  and go to -50'.  This would confuse the Word of Recall scroll, and
  ruin your character's day.  You would not go down from the town level
  to your old depth any more, but always go to -50'.  Word of Recall
  will still bring you from the dungeon to town, but walking down to
  2500' or deeper will become incredibly tedious...  For PC people
  who have already messed up their characters, I've put together a
  program to read in your savefile, set the "max level" to 0 (town),
  and write it back out again.  You'll still have to walk back down to
  whatever depth you were at, but you'll only have to do it once.  It
  is available at KSU as 'fix-lv.exe' in pub/Games/Moria/Angband/PC/
  patches.  Remember to ftp in binary mode.
  These 2 bugs should be fixed.
* Silver jellies could mess up the Arkenstone of Thrain.  This should be
  fixed.
* If you cast a spell/throw something at a monster with 0 hp, and your
  attack does 0 hp, it will cause a divide by zero error.  PC users
  will see this as the "guardian angel" message.  Your character should
  be saved.  This should be fixed.
* As I mentioned above, killing Sauron on any level except 4950' will
  mean that you have to fall through a trap door to get past level 99.
  This is because of a bug in the quest code, where it only lists a
  quest as done if you kill the quest monster on the correct level. 
  This should be fixed.
* Also, the very fact that you can fall through a trap door on a quest
  level is a bug.  At the moment, it's a good one, because otherwise the
  above bug would be serious.  This should be fixed.
* When a group of monsters is summoned, only one (?some) of them are lit
  initially.  A round later, all are properly lit, but this delay can
  be deadly.  This should be fixed.
* The movement code was wrong if you set the option to use the 'g' key
  to get objects.  The result was that you had to hit 'g' to enter a
  store, or to hit a trap.  I would have kept this last bit a secret,
  but someone already asked about it on rec.games.moria.  This should
  be fixed.
* If a unique monster was killed by a spell/breath from another monster,
  it would not be properly marked as deleted.  Also, if a quest monster
  (just Sauron for now) was killed, you would not get credit for
  completing the quest.  Because the monster was not marked as dead, you
  could face the unique AGAIN after it had died!  I have one report of
  someone who had to face Azriel THREE times, because something would
  breath on him when he had Azriel almost dead.  This should be fixed.
  Well, that's all of the common questions I can think of just now.
* The character creation code used to allow you to type ^P to get the
  stats from the previous character, even if there was no previous
  character.  Combined with the -n flag, this could get the stats of
  an existing character, but this would often cause some nasty bugs,
  as things were not getting properly initialized.  This should be
  fixed.
* Artifact bows did not cause a "special" feeling.  (An oversight...
  Sorry)  Additionally, because the bow code didn't properly handle
  "special" flags, normal or just (+0, +1) bows could be produced
  by killing Wormtongue or by reading a scroll of *Acquirement*.
  This should be fixed.

I will be adding to this file, and posting it regularly until someone
starts a real FAQ.  But I don't want to become the "keeper" of the FAQ...
I'll leave that honor to someone else (someone with more free time).
