News:
        This is a beta version of Angband which includes a number of bug
fixes from the net and from UMoria 5.5, PC Angband 1.32, and FAngband 1.0.
Note that this version does not include anything I considered too
revolutionary.  Consult the file fixes in the source directory for details.

Bugs:
        There is a redisplay bug that I haven't tracked down quite yet
involving the edges of the maps not being drawn; redisplay using CTRL-R or use
the 'M' command.   Please email other problems to "cs4w+@andrew.cmu.edu".
