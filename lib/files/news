News:
    *   Priests (and Paladins) need spellbooks to learn spells.
    *   Angband now has the targetting code from Morgul!  Use '*' to target.
Bugs:
    *  As always, I've tried to insure that Angband is free of problems
       before I release it.  But, to be safe, you should periodically
       make backups of your character, to protect him/her from bugs. -CFT
    *  Probing sometimes completely ignores a monster...  This may be
          related to the "monster heal bug" (which has been patched over,
          not truly fixed), but I don't know.
    *  Sometimes "special offers" in the stores seem to be ignored -- the
          shopkeeper asks for full price.  This seems to happen only with
          "stackable" items like arrows, etc.
