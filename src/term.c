/*
 * Some ideas may have been adapted from MacAngband 2.6.1
 *
 * Note that there is a rather large difference between the newer
 * "graphic based" machines and the older "text based" terminals.
 * Luckily, the only significant one for a game like "Angband"
 * is that the older machines have a "hardware cursor".
 *
 * There are also a few "tuning" issues, for example, the older
 * machines traditionally have very "expensive" routines to check
 * for a keypress without actually "waiting" for it.  So these
 * routines must be explicitly "requested".
 *
 * New machines:
 *   movement" across the screen is relatively cheap
 *   changing "colors" may take a little bit of time
 *   characters must be "erased" from the screen
 *   drawing characters may or may not first erase behind them
 *   drawing a character on the cursor will clear the cursor
 *
 * Old machines:
 *   expensive cursor movement
 *   hardware cursor (moves at every "print")
 *   printing characters erases the previous contents
 *   may have "fast" routines for "clear to end of line"
 *   may have "fast" routines for "clear entire screen"
