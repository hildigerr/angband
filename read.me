   To get Angband running, just edit THISDIR in the Makefile to whatever the
current directory is, and change any other directories if you want to. You may
need to change the compiler, as well.  Also, you need to have a
case-insensitive string comparision routine available.  Consult the
beginning of externs.h if you lack stricmp.

	Any problems, please mail cs4w@andrew.cmu.edu
